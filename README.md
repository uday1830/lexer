# lexer
A lexer to recognise the tokens in the given Mini-C program.
Input: A Mini-C program
Output:
● If the mini-C program is valid, output the sequence of tokens <token-id,
token-value>
● Print Error if the input does not have valid lexical tokens

we will work with a mini-C language whose features are a subset of
the features of the C language. The features are as listed below:
- Macros (#define)
- preprocessor directives ((#include)
- single line and multi line comments
- variables
- data types supported are integers
- Operators - arithmetic operators
- If-else and assignment statements
